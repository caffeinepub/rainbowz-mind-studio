  "summary": "Diff adds a TanStack React Router-based multi-page marketing frontend skeleton with shared layout (Navbar/Footer), reusable blocks (CTA, FAQ, comparison table, age selector), and a contact/demo form with basic validation + success state. However, evidence is insufficient for several specified visuals/assets and some required iconography; there are also a couple of unrequested additions (backend stub and external promotional footer link).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Generate and include required static visual assets as local static files under frontend/public/assets/generated, and render them in relevant sections (Hero, Our Method diagrams, iconography).",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows components that reference generated assets (e.g., thinline icon sprite), but does not show any added image files under frontend/public/assets/generated (and omitted files are not verifiable from the provided summary). Also only some required icon names appear supported in code.",

      "requirement": "Thin-line icon set must include (focus, memory, speed, creativity, assess, train, strengthen, apply) in a consistent style and be rendered as needed.",
      "reason": "ThinlineIcon component only supports four names ('focus' | 'memory' | 'speed' | 'creativity'); the additional required icons are not implemented in the shown code.",

      "requirement": "Contact / Book Demo page includes a “Map-like” visual block.",
